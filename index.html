        <h1>THE BOOK APP</h1>
        <p>This is the design process I took to come up with an app from ideation to hi-fi mockups. Bookworm is a book app concept that allows you to trade and buy books in your area. Simply choose some genres that interest you and you are on your way to share your love of books with those around you at the price you want.

        My process is started by sketching up some concepts and thinking about how I would like the user flow to take place. When I am happy with the flow I start to focus on the design of the UI elements. After some trial and error I moved on to creating some wireframes.

    	    BookWorm is a concept for a mobile app that allows users to trade and sell books in their area. The goal was to create an easy to use application that made it fun to connect with other book lovers like you.

    		  My process is started by sketching up some concepts and thinking about how I would like the workflow to take place. I keep these sketches rough until I start to see a process that I like. After some trial and error I moved on to creating some wireframes.

          Before I begin creating logos in Adobe Illustrator I like to create some moodboards for inspiration. From there I start sketching up some quick concepts with a pad and pencil. 
          After I have an idea of what the app will look like I try to find a color palette that works well with the style I have chosen. When I am happy with one of my color scheme I move into Illustrator and create some vector graphics.             
          When I get the logos and branding finished I use the moodboards and final logos to help me decide on the look and feel for the final high fidelity mockups. I then move into Photoshop to create the final mocks.
